- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gotham-Prabhu
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming languages and design patterns. I have an intermediate level expertise in SAP Integration technologies like Cloud platform Integration, API Management, Integration Advisor and Open Connectors. Have good know how in Java and Groovy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 4 main programming languages Java, Javascript, Python and Go. While my focus is on SAP Business Technology Platform and Google Cloud platform. Also I am heavily invested in getting to know Docker, Kubernetes, Kyma runtime.
